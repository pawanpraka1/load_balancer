Followings are pending task :-	

1. make the stats better. Currently load balancer is returning the stats string, which stats
client is simply printing. Make the data communication between load balancer and stats client 
be in binary format and let client do the print format handling.

2. make the load balancer work for IPV6 also.

3. Implement to handle SSL connection at the load balancer and handle all cpu intensive SSL task at the load balancer only 
so that backend servers can perform better.

4. Implement other load balancing algorithm, currently we have connection based round robin
method.

5. code decoration.

6. remove unnecessary ASSERT.
