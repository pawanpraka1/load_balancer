Compile the server :-

cd server
make clean
make

Now in server/server.conf put the ip and port entries for the backend servers

127.0.0.1 8888
127.0.0.1 9999

Now run the server which will listen on 7842 port for all load balancing request.
./server

then send the request to this server on 7842 port. It will load balance the requests
among the servers listed in the server.conf using the round robin policy.

There are test server and client code in the test directory. The server will read 
the clients data until it gets null character and client will send the null terminated 
data and waits for server to send null terminated string back. Server can be run using 
following command :-

./server -p <port> -s <send string>

it will listen on the given port(default 8888) and send <send string> to the client(default "pawan").

If you want to check stats which is a debug info, go to the stats directory

cd stats
make clean
make

and then to check the stats do :-

./stats
